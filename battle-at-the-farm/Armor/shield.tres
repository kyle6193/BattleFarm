Can combined with any other armor, thus making the saving throw 5+.
A model holding a shield cannot use the hand that's holding the shield for anything else. Also, can only use pistol type weapons in the second hand (which is not holding the shield). 
Can be slung on the back to free both hands, but consequently confer a movement penalty of 0.5. "
